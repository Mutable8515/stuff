# stuff
just stuff overflow stuff. May or may not add things over time. Due to laziness I'm using it as a share for now.

## apps
- app launcher and arch package manager script
  - ctrl+s puts in install mode to search core, extra, aur, and flathub for installation
  - ctrl+x puts in remove mode to search install apps and uninstall them
  - ctrl+r puts in launcher mode (default) to launch gui apps on system. works like typical launchers but in terminal and without icons
